# RShell

## Description
This is a shell created for CS100.

To run the tests, execute the test script (`tests/run_tests.sh`).

Parsing is done assuming the specifications of the assignment are true:

- `||` and `&&` operators are always surrounded by a space.
- The `;` operator does not have a space in front of it and is always followed by a space.
