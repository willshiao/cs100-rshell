# RShell

## Description
This is a shell created for CS100.

To run the tests, execute the test script (`tests/run_tests.sh`).

Parsing is done assuming the specifications of the assignment are true:

- `||` and `&&` operators are always surrounded by a space.
- The `;` operator does not have a space in front of it and is always followed by a space.

We used a Kanban board to manage tasks, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/willshiao/rshell/projects/1). A detailed overview of our initial design can be viewed [here](https://github.com/willshiao/rshell/raw/master/docs/rshell.pdf).
